    "section": "",
    "text": "After close to two decades in the IT industry where I started my journey as a software engineer and went through the typical grind and climbed the (so called) ladder of success, I had reached a juncture where I felt the need to reinvent myself.\nThe first thing which came to mind was to enable what I call as “CREATOR MODE”. To put simply it means that whatever ideas (crazy or not) are in my mind I should be able to implement them, I should be able the create that software. And that started the journey of curiousness, inquisitiveness, learning and re-learning. One of the things which was apparent in that was the need to have a digital presence.\nFor that very reason this site has been created to serve as a small island in the vast ocean of INTERNET, my digital home if you will. Here I am going to capture what I have learnt, and what I am learning now. Looking forward to how this adventure evolves and shapes up."
